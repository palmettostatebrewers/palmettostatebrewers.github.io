## What PSB Has to Offer

Members of PSB enjoy hosted events, brew sessions, a club bus trip, a new
member t-shirt and taster glass, and area discounts!

### Club Parties

Every year PSB hosts a Spring Party and Fall Party. Typically the spring party
is a Oyster Roast and the fall party is a classic Low-Country Boil.

People are welcome to bring food and beer to share!

### Monthly Brew Sessions

Each month a club member will open up their home and host other members. This
way the host can show off their setup and their particular brewing process. It
is one of the best ways to explore different options and learn more about the
craft.

Hosts, remember this is an informal event. Do not worry about having too
much food available or anything.

Guests, please bring snacks and treats, beer to share, and anything else
to show appreciation to the hosts.


### Annual Brew-Venture (Bus Trip)

Each year the club decides on a destination city, and charters a bus to drive
everyone around. This gives everyone a change to either visit some old classics
or new breweries.
