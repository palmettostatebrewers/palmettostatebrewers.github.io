## Meetings 

Meetings are held on the 2nd Monday of each month at Zorba's Greek Restaurant, 
**6169 St. Andrew's Road, Columbia, SC** in the Seven-Oaks Shopping Center. 
6:00-8:30PM. 

The beer selection there provides ample quality quaffs, but be sure to bring 
homebrew or special beer to share. The food is good, plentiful and economical. 

The pizza and Greek salads are recommended and the lamb chops are excellent.
