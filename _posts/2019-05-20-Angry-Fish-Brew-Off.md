Here are some more details to this local competition.  Angry Fish is asking us to brew a beer 
(or one you already brewed and feel is an award winner) and bring to their Brewery by 
`Thursday May 30th` (tentatively).  The owners will be tasting all entries and selecting one as 
the winner.  The winner of the beer will be able to brew and have their beer served at the brewery. 
The only styles that are not acceptable are Belgian and Sours with a personal preference toward 
IPA's and Stout/Porters. I have mentioned this competition at several meetings and based on 
some feedback, not all of our members were aware of this great opportunity to work with Angry Fish.

The deadline of `May 30th` can be pushed back if need be to allow everyone who wants to enter 
this competition.
