Our meeting will be held at Angry Fish for the Month of September. The good folks at Angry Fish, who are not open 
on Monday, are opening just for US. There should be plenty of seating; however, it would not hurt to have a lawn chain 
in your car just in case. We can enjoy some flights or pints before the meeting and sample homebrew during the meeting.

They have also arranged to have Little Mo's Greek food truck on site. This food truck is generally seen in 5 points, 
offers typical Greek fare and is quite delicious.

I set the time for 5:30 to allow for drinks and dinner prior to the meeting start time. Depending on how the 
August meeting start time goes, we may actually start the meeting at 6:30 instead of 7:00.

See ya'll at Angry Fish in September.
