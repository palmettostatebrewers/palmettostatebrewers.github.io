Welcome to the 2018 Palmetto State Brewers Open homebrew competition!  PSBO is a AHA/BJCP sanctioned
competition and proud participant in the Southeastern Homebrewers Association.  Entries will be
accepted in all beer, mead, and cider categories based on BJCP 2015 guidelines.

Judging and award ceremony will be held on **Dec 1st** at Krafty Draft Brewpub in Lexington, SC.  We
look forward to seeing many old friends each year at our competition.  

Entrants are limited to maximum of **12 entries** per Southeastern Homebrewers Association competition
rules.  Participants may submit only **1 entry** per BJCP subcategory.

Categories with low number of entries may be combined together for judging purposes.  Likewise,
categories with large number of entries may be split by subcategory for judging purposes.

Ribbons will be awarded for flight winners along with Best of Show in beer and mead/cider.

Charity raffle will be held on day of competition with 100% of the proceeds going to the _South
Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault_.  Last year PSBO raffle raised just
over $1,000 for Palmetto Place Children's Shelter.

Thank you in advance for your entries, signing up as judges and stewards, and supporting the
camaraderie that is homebrewing.  Hope to see many of you in December.  Cheers!
