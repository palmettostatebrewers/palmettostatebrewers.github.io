We are currently looking for someone to host the April Brew Session. A brew session is a great way to see how your fellow
club mates brew their beer. It is a good time to socalize and make friends. 

Usually the host will have some food and beer but the attendees can bring food and beer if they wish. If you are interested in hosting a brew session, reach out to Brian Gallup our VP of Social.
