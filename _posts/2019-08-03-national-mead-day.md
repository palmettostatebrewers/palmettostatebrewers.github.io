Organized by the American Homebrewers Association (AHA) in 2002, Mead Day was created to increase mead awareness and 
foster camaraderie among meadmakers. Homebrewers and meadmakers around the world are encouraged to invite friends 
and family to celebrate Mead Day by making a delicious batch of mead together!

This will be the 4th year that DIY has sponsored a local Mead Day event. Come join us at the store and lean the 
process of making mead at home. Justin Brooks will be giving a demonstration again this year of the process. 
As with years past, you can make a batch of mead alongside with Justin step by step.

I've asked a local bee keeper in the Elgin area if he would be available to give us a presentation on 
stewardship of bee keeping, display some wares of bee keeping, and why honey bees are an integral part of our 
ecological system.  Unfortunately, he is unavailable that day.  I've also contacted Blythewood Bee Company and 
asked them to join us, and maybe give a presentation.  Thus far after 2 conversations with the "secretary", no call 
back from the owner.  I don't expect him to attend.

For those interested in making a mead at the event, Justin and I have been in conversation about buying a 5 gal bucket 
(~60 lbs) of  local wildflower honey.  With enough interest, we can make it happen.  DIY has everything else available 
for making mead.  As homebrewers, we already have equipment for fermentation.  Perhaps for a first mead, you might 
consider making a smaller volume.  Typical batch sizes would be 1 gal, 3 gal, and 5 gal as those are most common volume 
sizes of secondary glass/plastic vessels.  Plan on 3 lbs honey per gal for a "standard" 10%-12% ABV mead.

Cheers, and hope to see many of you at the event!
