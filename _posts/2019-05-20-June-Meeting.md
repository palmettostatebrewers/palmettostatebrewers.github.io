## NEW LOCATION FOR JUNE ONLY!

Our June meeting this month will be held at Conquest Brewing.  The date and time of the 
meeting is the same as our regular meetings, just a different venue for this month.
We will have Cha's Cha's food truck on site to serve as dinner.  This is an awesome 
food truck with many options including Vegan.  So come early prior to our **7:00 PM** meeting start time 
to enjoy this delicious option.

The meeting will be held back in the production area, **please bring a chair** to 
make ourselves more comfortable.  There are a few chairs already 
there and they have a table for us to use.
