## Welcome

Welcome to the home of the Palmetto State's finest homebrewed ales, lagers, meads and ciders. 

We are passionately dedicated to producing and consuming quality beer. If you share our passion, you are 
cordially invited to become a member of an active fun loving bunch of guys and gals. We brew at all levels, 
from extract kits to all-grain. Think you might be interested but do not know where to start? This is the 
place! We love to share our knowledge and borrow others' ideas. Come see us. We love to sample each others' 
beer, so feel free to bring your best (or worst, if you want constructive criticism).

## Meetings 

Meetings are held on the 2nd Monday of each month at Zorba's Greek Restaurant, 
**6169 St. Andrew's Road, Columbia, SC** in the Seven-Oaks Shopping Center. 
6:00-8:30PM. 

The beer selection there provides ample quality quaffs, but be sure to bring 
homebrew or special beer to share. The food is good, plentiful and economical. 

The pizza and Greek salads are recommended and the lamb chops are excellent.
