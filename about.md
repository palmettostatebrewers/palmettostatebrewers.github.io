## Welcome

Welcome to the home of the Palmetto State's finest homebrewed ales, lagers,
meads, and ciders.

We are dedicated to producing and consuming quality beer. If you
share our passion, you are cordially invited to become a member of an active
fun loving bunch of guys and gals. We brew at all levels, from extract kits to
all-grain. Think you might be interested but do not know where to start? This
is the place! We love to share our knowledge and borrow others' ideas. Come see
us. We love to sample each others' beer, so feel free to bring your best (or
worst, if you want constructive criticism).

## Monthly Meetings

On the 2nd Monday of each month, we meet at 
[Zobra's on St. Andrew's Rd](https://goo.gl/maps/SymQTZ8SRDH2). 
Meeti starts at 7:00 PM, but most people arrive early to get a seat, eat dinner, and to socialize.

Meeting start with introductions, what memembers have brewed lately, 
announcemnts, and an eductional presentation. After that, we pass around
people's homebrew for feedback and just general sharing!
